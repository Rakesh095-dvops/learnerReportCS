Hereâ€™s an analysis of your MERN application and the Helm chart in the learner-report directory:

### MERN Application Structure

#### Backend (learnerReportCS_backend)
- **Type:** Node.js/Express backend (part of MERN stack).
- **Key files/folders:**
  - `index.js`: Likely the main entry point for the Express server.
  - `controllers/`: Contains controller files for different features (admin, assessment, assignment, etc.).
  - `models/`: Mongoose models for MongoDB collections.
  - `routes/`: Express route definitions, mapping endpoints to controllers.
  - `database/mongoDb.js`: MongoDB connection logic.
  - `middlewares/`: Custom Express middleware.
  - `config.env`: Environment variables.
  - `Dockerfile`: For containerizing the backend.

#### Frontend (learnerReportCS_frontend)
- **Type:** React application (part of MERN stack).
- **Key files/folders:**
  - `src/`: Main React source code.
    - `App.js`, `index.js`: Main React entry points.
    - `api/queries.js`: API calls to backend.
    - `AuthRouter/`, `components/`, `context/`: React components, context, and routing.
  - `public/`: Static files (HTML, manifest, etc.).
  - `Dockerfile`: For containerizing the frontend.

### Helm Chart Analysis (learner-report)

- **Purpose:** The Helm chart is used to deploy the MERN application (frontend and backend) on Kubernetes.
- **Key files:**
  - `Chart.yaml`: Chart metadata (name, version, description).
  - `values.yaml`: Default configuration values (image tags, service types, etc.).
  - `templates/`: Contains Kubernetes resource templates:
    - `backend-deployment.yaml` & `backend-service.yaml`: Define the backend deployment and service.
    - `frontend-deployment.yaml` & `frontend-service.yaml`: Define the frontend deployment and service.

#### How it works:
- The chart allows you to deploy both the backend and frontend as separate Kubernetes Deployments and Services.
- You can customize image names, ports, and other settings via `values.yaml`.
- The templates use Helm templating syntax to inject values and create Kubernetes manifests.

**Summary:**  
Your workspace contains a typical MERN stack application, with a clear separation between backend (Node.js/Express/MongoDB) and frontend (React). The learner-report Helm chart is set up to deploy both parts of the application to Kubernetes, making it easy to manage and scale in a cloud-native environment.
